## Description
The Cyber Store Services app is an e-commerce back-end database management system which provides users with a program to create and maintain a database of e-commerce inventory. The program utilizes the Express.js API to use Sequelize and interact with a MySQL database. Request routes enable operations to create, read, update, and delete and are executed through use of Sequelize models.

Future development for this app would include functions to manage customer accounts and orders.
